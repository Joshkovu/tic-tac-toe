# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project

I created this game to:
- Strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals  
- Practice useState, component hierarchy, and data flow  
- Gain hands-on experience in building reusable components  
- Handle game logic, conditional rendering, and UX design

ðŸš€ Features

- Two-player game (X and O) with turn-based logic  
- Winner detection and game reset functionality  
- Dynamic UI updates using React hooks  
- Clean, responsive design

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- React â€“ UI library (Hooks, JSX, component structure)  
- CSS â€“ Styling and layout  
- JavaScript (ES6) â€“ Logic handling

ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Managing local state with useState  
- Passing props between components  
- Implementing conditional rendering  
- Thinking in a component-based architecture
